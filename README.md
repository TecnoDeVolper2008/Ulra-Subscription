## Usage
👉 To use one of these configurations, simply open the configs.txt file located in the root directory. This file contains a list of links to various 2ray configuration files that you can use with your V2ray client. Copy [THIS LINK](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/barry-far/V2ray-Configs/main/All_Configs_Sub.txt) link of the configuration file you want to use from the configs.txt file and import it into your V2ray client. Refer to your client's documentation for more information on how to do this.

❕If upper link didnt work for you , use this link instead : [All_Config_base64_Sub.txt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/barry-far/V2ray-Configs/main/All_Configs_base64_Sub.txt)

Just Copy these links to your client to use :

- Dialog:
```
https://ultra-vpn-v2rayconfig-subcription.netlify.app/Dialog.txt
```

- Slt: 
```
https://ultra-vpn-v2rayconfig-subcription.netlify.app/Slt.txt
```

🔒 To ensure the best possible performance and security, we recommend subscribing to our latest configurations using the subscription link feature. Simply copy the subscription link from the configs.txt file and paste it into your V2ray client to receive automatic updates every 10 minutes.
